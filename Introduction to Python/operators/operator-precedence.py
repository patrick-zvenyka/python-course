#Operator precedence in Python determines the order in which operations
# are evaluated in an expression. Hereâ€™s a simplified table (from highest
# to lowest precedence):

#Precedence Level	             Operators
        #1                     exponentiation
        #2                 multiplication or division
        #3                   addition or subtraction


x = 4 * 7 - 8 + 5
print(x)
